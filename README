Diploma Thesis : Cache efficient algorithm for applying random permutations to a matrix

Permutations are used widely in mathematics, especially in the field of Combinatorics. Furthermore, permutations are widely utilized in computer science. 
Applying a suitable permutation on a set of data can potentially lead to higher levels of spatial locality and as a result boost the performance of algorithms applied to them.
Simple hierarchical methods for implementing a permutation are presented and efforts are made in order to develop cache efficient algorithms for this purpose.

In conclusion, the purpose of this paper is the in depth understanding of the functionality of cache memory and its proper utilization
in order to boost the performance of matrix transpositions and matrix permutations.
